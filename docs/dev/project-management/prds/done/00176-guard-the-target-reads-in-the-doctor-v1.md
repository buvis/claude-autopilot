# Guard the target reads in the doctor

Source: PRD 00173's review cycle 1 — Blake's residual-unguarded-operations finding and Eve's first KNOWN item, both against `dev/local/reviews/00173-guard-the-canonical-read-in-the-doctor-verdict-v1-review-1.md`. Filed 2026-09-05. This is the next layer of the onion PRD 00169 → 00173 has been peeling: 00169 guarded the import scan, 00173 guarded the canonical reads, and the target-side reads are what remain.

## Overview

### Problem Statement

`skills/use-codex/scripts/codex_hook_doctor.py` still aborts the whole run with exit 2 and no TSV rows when a **target** (rather than a canonical) cannot be read. Three unguarded paths remain, all confirmed by reading, one confirmed live:

1. `_verdict_for` compiles the target with `compile(target.read_bytes(), ...)`. `read_bytes()` raises `OSError` when the target is a directory or is unreadable. `check` collects targets from `hooks_dir.glob("*.py")`, and **glob matches directories**, so a directory literally named `something.py` under `hooks/` aborts the run. Confirmed live during the 00173 review: `error: [Errno 21] Is a directory: .../hooks/x.py`, exit 2.
2. `_verdict_for`'s staleness comparison reads the target a second time (`canonical_bytes != target.read_bytes()`). Same exposure, and it is a second read of a file that may have changed since the first.
3. `_repair_known`'s write path (`tmp_path.write_bytes(canonical_bytes)` then `os.replace(tmp_path, target)`) is unguarded. A read-only hooks directory, a full disk, or a permission change between check and write raises `OSError` out of `repair`: exit 2, and any targets not yet processed get no row at all.

`_verdict_for` also calls `target.stat()` right after `target.exists()`. That is a check-then-act window: a target removed between the two calls raises `OSError` from `stat()`.

The batch codex health probe reads this exit code. Exit 2 means "the doctor itself could not run", so one broken file on the host currently masks the verdict of every other hook.

### Target Users

The operator running `repair` against a damaged plugin cache, and the batch codex health probe reading the doctor's exit code.

### Success Metrics

- A target that is a directory, or unreadable, yields one row for that target and the run exits 1 or 3, never 2.
- A repair whose write fails yields `unrepairable` for that target, still processes every remaining target, and never exits 2.
- A target deleted between `exists()` and `stat()` is verdicted, not raised.
- Every existing verdict string and `_report`'s counting stay unchanged; `skills/use-codex/SKILL.md`'s exit-code list needs no edit.

## Functional Decomposition

### Capability: Doctor verdicts

#### Feature: An unreadable target verdicts itself
- **Description**: a target that exists but cannot be read verdicts that one target instead of aborting the run.
- **Inputs**: a target whose `read_bytes()` or `stat()` raises `OSError` — a directory, a permission-denied file, or one removed mid-run.
- **Outputs**: a `syntax_error` verdict for that target with the `OSError` text in the detail; exit 1 or 3 through `_report`'s existing counting.
- **Behavior**: guard both `target.read_bytes()` calls and the `stat()` in `_verdict_for`, mapping `OSError` to `syntax_error` with the `OSError` text as the detail. No new verdict string: `syntax_error` already carries a detail and gates the rung off, which is the safe direction for a hook that cannot be read.

#### Feature: A failed write costs one row, not the run
- **Description**: an `OSError` from the repair write is reported for that target and does not stop the remaining targets.
- **Inputs**: a hooks directory that is read-only, full, or whose permissions changed after the check.
- **Outputs**: `unrepairable` for that target with the `OSError` in the detail; every other target still processed.
- **Behavior**: guard `tmp_path.write_bytes(...)` and `os.replace(...)` in `_repair_known`, and remove the temp file if it was created before the failure, so a failed repair leaves no `.tmp` litter beside the hook.

## Structural Decomposition

### Repository Structure

```
skills/use-codex/scripts/codex_hook_doctor.py                  # Maps to: both features
skills/use-codex/scripts/test_codex_hook_doctor_parse_errors.py  # Maps to: regression tests (the other three doctor test modules are at 772/789/795 against the 800-line limit)
CHANGELOG.md
```

### Module: hook-doctor
- **Maps to capability**: Doctor verdicts
- **Responsibility**: the guarded target reads and the guarded repair write.
- **Exports**: none new (`_verdict_for` and `_repair_known` keep their signatures)

## Dependency Graph

### Foundation Layer (Phase 0)
No dependencies.

- **hook-doctor**: the guarded target reads and write.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Guard the target paths
**Goal**: no host file can abort the doctor with exit 2.

**Tasks**:
- [x] Guard both `target.read_bytes()` calls and the `stat()` in `_verdict_for`, mapping `OSError` to `syntax_error` with the `OSError` text as the detail; one fail-first test using a directory named `*.py` under `hooks/` asserting `check` never exits 2 (no deps) - Acceptance: `uv run --no-project --with pytest python -m pytest -q skills/use-codex/scripts` green with the new test present, and the test fails against the pre-change module.
- [x] Guard `tmp_path.write_bytes` and `os.replace` in `_repair_known`, cleaning up a partial `.tmp`; one fail-first test with a read-only hooks directory asserting the other targets still get rows (depends on task 1); CHANGELOG `**use-codex**` under Fixed - Acceptance: suite green; `bash dev/bin/release-checks` green.

**Exit Criteria**: suite green; `bash dev/bin/release-checks` green.

## Test Strategy

### Critical Scenarios
- **Happy path**: a readable stale target with a readable canonical → Expected: `repaired`, unchanged from today.
- **Edge case**: a directory named `x.py` under `hooks/` → Expected: one row for it, exit 1 or 3, never 2, and every other target still verdicted.
- **Error case**: a read-only hooks directory during repair → Expected: `unrepairable` for the target that could not be written, rows for all others, no leftover `.tmp` file, never exit 2.

## Risks

- A test that makes a directory read-only must restore its mode in teardown, or it leaves an undeletable `tmp_path` behind and poisons later runs. Use a fixture with explicit cleanup; skip the case when running as root, where mode bits do not deny.
- Mapping target `OSError` onto `syntax_error` widens what that verdict means; the detail column carries the `OSError` text, and the code comment records why no new verdict was added (a new string would touch `_report`'s counting and `SKILL.md`'s exit-code list).


## Completion

Completed manually on 2026-09-05; no autopilot run or state was created.
Implementation commits: ece9ac3, 31fe06b, 6906a89, fdee7b9. Integrated on master at 560f061, preserving the concurrent v0.5.1 release and keeping this fix under Unreleased.

Four review cycles ran consensus, blind, and doubt/de-slop lenses in cleared subagent contexts. Review 04 has zero actionable findings; its two raw observations are explicitly resolved or dismissed. Reviews and verbatim supporting artifacts remain under dev/local/reviews. Native reviewers shared a model; external CLI guards prevented model diversity.

Final verification at 560f061: 2616 passed, 1 pre-existing skip, 4 pre-existing warnings, 459 subtests passed; 224 release checks passed. The 91-test doctor suite passed on Python 3.10, 3.13, and 3.14. Reviewed doctor and test blobs are identical after integration.
